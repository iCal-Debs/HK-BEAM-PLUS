# HK-BEAM-PLUS

1. Introduction

- This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of HK Beamplus Green Building Certification in Hong Kong. Utilising data-driven insights, the project seeks to understand **certification trends**, **customer preferences**, **type of buildings certified**, and **city performance**.
- The analysis is encapsulated in a Jupyter notebook titled beam-plus.ipynb, which explores various facets of the certification data, ranging from **exploratory data analysis** to **predictive modelling**.

2. ## Dataset Description
The dataset, hkgbc_beamplus_project_listing.csv, comprises 2729 entries spanning several key metrics:

1. **Project Name**: Includes the name of the project
2. **District**: Covers the district/ location of each project.
3. **Project Type**: Provides data on type of building (residential, commericial, etc)
4. **Green Build Cert Label No**: Contains the certification number or label.
5. **Owner / Developer Name**: Provides the name of the owner/ developer.
6. **Current Status**: Indicates whether the project is registered, provisional or final and types.


3. ## Analysis Overview
The Jupyter notebook conducts a meticulous analysis in several stages:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Initial stage focusing on preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values and refining data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth exploration of the dataset through various visualisations, aiming to uncover trends and patterns.

3. **Certification Trend Analysis**: Examination of certification over time to identify seasonal trends and other temporal patterns.

4. **Predictive Modelling**: Implementation of forecasting models like ARIMA to predict future certification trends.


4. ## Results and Conclusions
The analysis yields valuable insights into HK Beamplus certification dynamics in the Hong Kong market. Key findings include:

1. **Seasonal trends** and their impact on different project types.

2. **Performance analysis** of various regions in terms of project volume and certification.

3. **Predictive forecasts** providing a future outlook on certification trends.

The project concludes with actionable recommendations based on the insights derived from the data, potentially guiding strategic decisions for HKGBC and certification teams.


5. ## Usage
To delve into the analysis, open the beam-plus.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the notebook. The dataset hkgbc_beamplus_project_listing.csv should be placed in the same directory as the notebook for seamless integration.


6. ## Contributions and Feedback
Feedback and contributions to this project are highly welcome. Please feel free to suggest improvements or additional analyses that could enhance the understanding of the certification data.
